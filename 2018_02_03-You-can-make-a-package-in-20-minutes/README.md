# Setup

The talk will mainly be a interactive demo, if you would like to follow along

- [R and the RStudio IDE](http://happygitwithr.com/install-r-rstudio.html) - I will be using R 3.4.3 and the RStudio Preview (v1.1.350).
- [devtools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=devtools), [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) and [usethis](https://cran.r-project.org/package=usethis) from CRAN.

    `install.packages(c("devtools", "roxygen2", "testthat", "usethis"))`

- Please run `update.packages(ask = FALSE, checkBuilt = TRUE)` to make sure your packages are fully updated.
